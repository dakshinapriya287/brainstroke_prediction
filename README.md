**#Brain Stroke Type Prediction Using CNN**
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the type of brain stroke from CT scan images. The model classifies strokes into Ischemic or Hemorrhagic, providing an AI-powered tool to support early diagnosis and treatment decisions.
**#Features**
•	Image Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation of CT scan images.
•	CNN Model: Deep learning model for accurate classification of stroke types.
•	Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
•	Visualization: Display predictions and confidence on CT scan images.
•	Optional Input: Demographic or clinical features (age, gender, hypertension, heart disease).
**#Stroke Types**
•	Ischemic Stroke: Caused by a blockage in blood vessels supplying the brain.
•	Hemorrhagic Stroke: Caused by bleeding in the brain due to ruptured vessels.
**#Dataset**
The dataset consists of labeled CT scan images classified as Ischemic or Hemorrhagic.
